/* `mark_completed` and `wait` can throw in the lock call, but its difficult to
recover from either. An exception in `wait` means the post condition of joining
all threads cannot be achieved, and an exception in `mark_completed` means
certain deadlock. `noexcept` qualifier will force a call to `std::terminate` if
locking throws an exception, which should only happen if a recursive lock
attempt is made (which is not possible since no external function is called
while holding the lock). */
